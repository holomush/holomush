# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-07)

**Core value:** Players can play HoloMUSH end-to-end (create characters, communicate, roleplay in scenes)
through either telnet or the web client, with every access-control decision default-deny and every plugin
trusted identically.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Channels Subsystem

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Channels Subsystem)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-07 — Brownfield ingest (48 SPECs + invariant registry + `docs/roadmap.md` theme
narratives) synthesized into PROJECT.md/REQUIREMENTS.md/ROADMAP.md, grounded against a prior
`/gsd-map-codebase` static analysis and live `bd`/codebase verification of shipped vs. forward scope.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log lives in PROJECT.md "Key Decisions". Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Ingest resolution**: scenes are plugin-owned (`core-scenes`), superseding the 2026-01-22
  `world-model-design.md` locations-table scene section (INGEST-CONFLICTS.md WARNING 1)
- **Ingest resolution**: web structural scene writes use typed RPCs (proto→facade→BFF), superseding E9.5's
  command-path-only decision for structural writes (INGEST-CONFLICTS.md WARNING 2)
- **Codebase verification**: confirmed via `rg`/`bd` that Scenes/RP (Epic 9, all 17 specs through
  focus-routed-input) is fully shipped; Channels/Forums/Discord plugins do not exist in-tree; `eventkit`/
  `groupkit` SDKs are not yet extracted (consistent with INV-S7's N=2 deferral)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Forums (Epic 11, `holomush-djj`) has no design yet — blocks any Forums-integration forward work
- Discord integration (Epic 12) depends on Phase 1 (Channels) shipping plus an OAuth substrate not yet built
- 259/334 registered invariants are `binding: pending` (concentrated in INV-CRYPTO and INV-SCENE) — tracked
  epic `holomush-hz0v4`, not a blocker, but phases touching crypto/scenes should bind relevant invariants as
  part of their own definition of done

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from the ingest, not part of this roadmap:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Social-spaces | Forums integration (Epic 11) | No design yet | Ingest 2026-07-07 |
| Social-spaces | Discord/Slack bridging + OAuth linking (Epic 12) | Blocked on Channels + OAuth substrate | Ingest 2026-07-07 |
| Web portal | Non-scene web surfaces (building/world editing, admin UI) | Directional theme goal, not yet spec'd | Ingest 2026-07-07 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-07 — `.planning/` bootstrap via ingest (SYNTHESIS.md/constraints.md/context.md) plus
prior `/gsd-map-codebase` run; PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md written and awaiting user
review/approval.
Stopped at: ROADMAP created (3 forward phases: Channels Subsystem, Scenes Lineage Completion, Platform
Hardening & Deployment Scaling); awaiting user approval before `/gsd-plan-phase 1`.
Resume file: None
