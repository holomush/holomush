# 21. Shadow Mode Cutover Criteria

> [Back to Decision Index](../README.md)

**Superseded by [Decision #37](037-no-shadow-mode.md).** Shadow mode is removed
entirely — there are no production releases to validate against.

~~**Original decision:** Objective cutover criteria (7 days, 10K checks, 100%
agreement). No longer applicable.~~
